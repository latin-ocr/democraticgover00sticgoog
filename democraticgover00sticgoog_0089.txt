we nse in political organizaticn merely humen
methods and human wisdom, Ι nm unable to see
eny means whereby a body oi men cen be better
selected to be the supreme body in the state.

This p1ineipls is essential in the'fmming oi any
government that ean properly be called democret-
ie. Even if we should concede thet there was
some sonnd, practicnble method for selectingu
wiser body of men for its purpose than the elect
ed popular assembly (which I do not believe), yet
any system oi* governmcut wherein the supreme
control of affairs is vested in any one man, or in
any body of men other than the popular assembly,
could not be called democretic. By no other sys
tem can we secure the free voice oi each individual
citizen, or the supremacy ol the will of the people.

But iu order thet this popular assembly should
do the work of which it is capable, the action of
this assembly of men, niter they ere selected, mnst
be free. Represeutntives must bs free es well as

the citizen.
How thet result is to be obtained depende on

points yet to be considered.
