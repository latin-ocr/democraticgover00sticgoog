Niciam the working of what I consider
would bc a democratic government has been to a
great extent considered in the preceding discussion
ofprinciples. What is said in this chapter will nec·
essarily be largely in the nature of a summary and
regrouping oi points that have been before mado.

Το a certain extent, too, what is here said as to
the working of a gowernment framed on the prin·
ciples already stated will be'matter of speculation.
But it will henot wholly such. There is no prin·
ciple herc stated that has not already been fully
tested, and established by experience. The popu-
lar assembly is as old os the oldest historical rec·
orde. It is the only known, and as far as I can
sce, the only possible, means whereby men of dif-
ferent ways of thinking can form a common judg·
ment. So long as human nature is constituted as
it now is, to accomplish that result easily and qnick·
ly, it is necessary for men to meet and confer,
openly snd harmonicusly. ¹ Tlren they can agros.
