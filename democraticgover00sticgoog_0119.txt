to the people a real control over publio affairs, that
would be one point in ite favor. If it did really
make representatives responsible to tho people‚
that would be one point iu its favor. It does not
aeoomplish either oi those results. It gives the
control of publio affairs to professione] politieiane.

It gives the seleution of these representativea to
professional politioians. It makes these representa-
tives responsible to professional politieiane. It
gradually and surely debasee the quality of the

highest publio officials, and through them of the
vvhole publio serviae.

In the next place tenure by election for the
members of the popular representative assemblies
makes it impossible for those membere to do their
best vvork. A system of tenure by eleotion for
those members puts every single member of every
popular representative assembly under the strong·
est pressure to be faitblese to his publio truste.
Tho tendenoy ie to maire all the highest publio
offioials in the nation sacrifice publio to personal
interests. Every member is oompelled to loolr ont
for his reelention. He is oompelled to 'conciliate
tho rich and powerful interests that oontrol nomi·
natione, and electione· The theory ie that the ue·

esseity of carrying the next eleetion eompels the .
representative to serve the intereeta of the people,'
