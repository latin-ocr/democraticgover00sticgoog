All the citizens would meet. Up to the last mo
ment any man could nominate a candidate. Any
man could discuss the fitness of candidates. After
nominatione had been made, and discussion had,
¹the citizens would make their selection, from
nominatione made on the spot and at the time, of
public officials and delegates. Every man would
have his'one free voice, not only iu selecting from
nominatione already made, but in making new
nominatione. Thecanying oi an election would
be a matter at which ordinary citizens could ac
complieh some substantia] result, by giving to ita
reasonable amount oi time, by simple, natural
methods which all men understand, by attending
the 'public meeting oi citizens established by the
law, where both the work oi nomination and elec·
tion would be done at the same time, and by the
= same body oi men, the assembly oi citizens thern·
selves. The process used by the delegates who·
were chosen by the primery meetings would be the
same. Α It would be the old, siurple, rudimentsry
process oi the town meeting. Can we devise any·
thing simpler, or anything bettert κ

Mensores, with the abolition oi the term eya.
tem, the certainty of large numbers oi periodical
contemporaneous veeancies vauishes. ⁴The great
prizes oi politius are made distant and uncertain.
