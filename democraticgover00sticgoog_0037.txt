men, by the process oi popular election. If, then,
the principle has any value at all, its chief velus
is to be found in its application to the process oi
popular election.

The consideration oi tho principle will be easier,
if we first take an illustration of what would bo
its working in this process of popular election.
Take first the caso of the election of the public
officers oi a viliago or small town, with a popula
tion of about two thousand, which would give
about four hundred voting citizens. The individ-
uel citizens would meet in their own persons, and
voto direetly for the officials to bs chonon. Toka
tho case of a large city, with apopulation oi heli a
million, which would mean about ons hundred
thousand voting citizens. If the city were divided
into prinrary election districts of two hundred and
fifty voters each, there would be four hundred pri·
marydistriots. Thecitizensinoachprimarydistrict
would meet in one body, and elect their ono repre
sentative. The four hundred representativcs thus
elected would meet in ono body, und elect the pub
lio officers. · In cases where the number of citizens
who were to voto was very lorge, it would at times
be necessary to lrave another grado of intermediate
electoral bodies (or possibly even moro than ons),
to elect tho members of the final electoral body
