the laet hundred years has been aseriee oi strug-
gles for power between great fectione,that thetis
the ultimate stageofpoliticaldeuelepment. They

public affairs is to place oue fection in power fora
time, until it oeaees to command public confidence,
and theu te place in control some other fection,
with different socelled political principles, until, in
its turn, it caeses to command public confideuoe.
Beating to windward served very well forthe pur·
poees of politioal navigatiou in the days oi political
eailiug·vessels,and weakerpolitical forces. Polit

¹ ical forces have grown with the growth of other

things. We now use politice] elsam and elec
tricity. We must find new political methodo.

a nation’s affairs must be a body oi wise meu,
with broad traiuiug and large political experienoe,
with the necessary provisions for bringing in,
gradually, new single men to takethe place of old
men as they go out, aud ior· selecting these new
men by the most careiul possible teste. But to
have these meu elected and reelected every two
years, or four years, or ten years, to keep the po
litical atoms in a state oi continued revolution-is
to use in politice the methodo oi the haleidoeoope.
