vidual citizen his free voice.

· count, to cast his vote for a man or measure that

is put forward and supported beforehand by some

the less froewill be the citizeu's action. Take the

, case oi the election of public officials by the peopie

of a large city, or a· state, or a, nation. If the eiti-

zens vote separately, directly for the public officer
to be chotun, the citizen in one town must not only
vote with other citizens in the same town, but with

cr states. The larger the district through which
the election is to be had, the largor and more thor-

state and national election organizantium, which are
formed for the purpose of carrying electione, be-

amounts oi time, labor, and money. It becomes

very intricate. It requires great shill and experi· ¹
