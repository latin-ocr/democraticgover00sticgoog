term electione 111 111 members 11 the representa·
tive popular'asscmblies, that any people should
have 1 healthy politioal 1111. Let me take as an
illustratiou the position 11 affairsat 1111 time 111
these United Stetes. ’1111 members 11 111 na·
111111 Congress and 11 111 state legislatores alone,
not including the members 11 representative pop

general election becomes in effect a general reve
lntion.· In any large people, 11 all the 1111111111
11 111 111 legislative bodies hold office by the ten·
