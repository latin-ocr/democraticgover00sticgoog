any reasonable hope oi getting under the contiuu-
ance oi our present elective system, which is worlr·

politioal methodo. It is only justice to these men
now in office that they should have the opportunity
to show their fitness for the places they now hold.
They have,for the time, uudcr our authority, been
taken from other callings, and to a certain extent
disabled from following other occupatione. In
time, and notin any very long time, the operation
oi natural forces would wesd out ¹tho useless men,
and bring in better oues. In time, the public ser·
vice would puriiy itself. In time, aud as time
should show the need oi it, new public men, bnt
especially „ new public methods, would supplant
ihose now in existence. - . ·

The adoption of a new system, in this way,
would be without shoolr, and without violent op
’ position from existing vested interestsand enisting
powers. It would bs as'easy as switching a mil-
way train from a side traok to the main line.
Everything would move smoothly. There would
be no immediate change oi men. Buta 'very great
change, in both men and methods, would come,
through natural causes, in easy, natural ways-in
time. .
