will oi any one man, or alass of men3 itisenew

the will oi that assembly oi men. That is what
always happens, whenever any body of individuale
meets, to deside on a common course of aetion.
The wisdom ol the aetion will, of course, depend

on the wisdom of the individuale. But the aetion,
when taken, is the aetion, not of the individuale,

oi a people, through the meeting of individual
minda, is to be found iu the proceedings oi the
Convention ol 1787 that framed our N ational Con·

process of agreement, ou a new thing, whieh was,
at the beginning, in the mind of no one man,
which was, at the end, what no one man wished
-to whieh howevertlrat assembly of men agreed
