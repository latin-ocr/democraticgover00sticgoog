To consider the probablo working, so iar as we
cau forecast it, of a politioal system framed ou the
principles here developed-that is tho next step iu
this political study.

As nearly as I am able to discern, the probable
working results of suoh a system would be as fol-
lows:

1. Such a system would tend to secure a free,
healthy political life ¹for the individual citizen.

First, end foremost‚ it would tend to give to the
citizen political freedoru. It would teud to de·
stroy the great organizations of men who make
the eanyiug of elections their profession. The

amount of election work would bo reduced to the ·

minimum. The ouly elective offioeswould bethose
of the chief administrative heads of the different

¹ bodies politio,'and the representatives to the differ-

ent popular assemblies. Electious lor those high-
. est public offices, instead of being held at frequent
fixcd interram, would come only when there were
wacancies. The time of any such vaoancies would
be uncertain. At any one meeting of citizens iu
the primary popular assemblies it would seldom
bo the case that citizens would have to do more
iu tlre way of election work thau elect one or two
delegates to popular electoral assemblies. The
process of election would be extremely simple.
